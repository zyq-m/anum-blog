                Next up about my beloved niece and nephew, Nufa Qisha and Nazmi Qhariz. Nufa Qisha was my brother's first child and was 3 years old.she is girl of a lot of talk and love to sing.
            <p class="mt-[24px] text-[#767676] leading-loose">
               Nufa was a wise child because he was able to memorize the songs, he heard for two days. And Nazmi is the brother of nufa. Nazmi is a chubby boy and constantly cries because he is very strong at drinking milk. In a day he'll drink milk eight times. I can't bear to see it either but I'm grateful that they both don't have any ill-fated diseases.
