                My father died for 15 years, and my great-grandmother was the one who was patient and resilient in caring for us.  He was very concerned for me and my siblings. He was also the one who used to pick me up and send me to school first and now it's my turn to take him where he is. He was a firm but kind person. He likes to hear our stories every time we come back from school or anywhere. He never once complained during our care. I hope he goes to heaven for the good he did to us. God only can repay his kindness.
